### Welcome to the Plant Ecology Lab at the University of Cape Town!

Our mission is to improve our fundamental understanding of African ecosystems and translate that knowledge into tools to assist the management and conservation of their biodiversity and contributions to people.

<img src="assets/images/jasper.jpg" alt="Jasper" class="rounded-circle" width="30%"/>

##### Jasper Slingsby

Principal Investigator

Following my PhD exploring the interface between ecology and evolution in the Cape Floristic Region, I worked at the [Fynbos Node](https://fynbos.saeon.ac.za/) of the [South African Environmental Observation Network](https://www.saeon.ac.za/) for almost a decade, focusing on global change and long term ecological research in African ecosystems. My current research blends the two, following the ethos that understanding the origins of diversity is essential if we are to understand how ecosystems function, how they are being altered by global change, and how best to manage them for desirable outcomes.
