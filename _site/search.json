    "text": "The NRF-funded RReTool project focused on developing Rapid and Repeatable tools for monitoring and mitigating global change impacts on natural resources in South Africa, predominantly using remote sensing.\nRecent advances in the availability of regularly updated, high resolution remotely-sensed data, combined with advances in computation have made it possible to monitor ecosystems at higher spatial and temporal resolution than previously possible. Much of the focus in research and the development of tools to make use of this new data has been in the forested ecosystems of the northern hemisphere and the tropics. More than 90% of South Africa’s terrestrial surface is covered by “open” non-forest ecosystems such as shrublands, woodlands and grasslands. Detecting abnormal change in these ecosystems is highly challenging, because the state of the vegetation varies dramatically due to natural disturbances, long-term trends or cyclical functions, such as those relating to fire, postfire recovery, and seasonality. Overcoming these challenges is critical, because open ecosystems dominate much of the globe, making up >40% of the global total ecosystem organic carbon and harbour a substantial proportion of the world’s biological diversity.\nWith the National Research Foundation funded RReTool project, we are developing tools to make full use of the potential of satellite data for monitoring the non-forests ecosystems that dominate South Africa, and to deepen our understanding of how they vary in space and time. Using this information we are improving our ability to manage and mitigate the impacts of threats such as invasive alien plants, land cover transformation and climatic change. All of this is being achieved using only freely available open source software, and publicly available data, and reproducible research principles. The information and tools generated will therefore be available at no expense to researchers and managers to use and modify as needed, allowing outputs to be regularly updated and/or improved. This will ensure that environmental resource management is informed by up-to-date accurate data."

We will split into 4 teams of 2 or 3. Each pair will survey a point location (towards the corners) within the 250 by 250m MODIS satellite mission pixel that makes up each site.\nEach team will need:\n\nOne or more smartphones\n2 x 10m measuring tape (or longer)\n1 x clipboard, paper and pen or pencil\n1 x densiometer\n1 x metre rule\n1 x Vernier calipers\n8 x large plastic bags for carrying soil and plant samples for each point location\n8 x soil sample bags\n2 x masking tape\n2 x marker pen\n\nAt each site, navigate to your team’s point location, lay out the two tapes at 90 degrees, crossing at 3.2m and ending at 6.4m. Consider this your guide for a 3.2m radius (~20m2) circle. Within the circle we will measure:\n\nEnvironmental conditions:\n\n\nEstimate % projected cover (think the area you would see from above) bare soil\nTake a densiometer reading at ground level. To do this, hold the densiometer level on the soil surface. Pick a spot close to the centre, but try not to pick an obviously open (or closed) patch, it should be representative of the location. To take a reading, split each square into quarters and score them for the amount of light visible - a value from 0 (complete canopy cover) to 4 (no vegetation visible) - counting up these values for all 24 squares (to a maximum of 96), and write this down. We will convert this to canopy cover later, applying the formula \\(100 - 1.04*X\\), where \\(X\\) is your reading.\nTake a soil sample (we are going to pool the 4 samples per site). These we will process for soil pH.\nDo a dung count, scoring dung for the point location by the number of quarters where you find dung (i.e. a single score from 0-4 for the point location). Try to avoid scoring obvious single scat (“dung creation”) events in more than one quadrat, unless it’s an impressive pile.\nTake a few notes (and photos) on any other features that you think may be important or interesting (slope, rockiness, whatever).\n\n\n\nDiversity sampling:\n\n\nFirst, make sure your smartphone is fully charged and set to record GPS location with your photographs!\nWith your team, decide on which are the top 5 species by % projected cover. If your site is dominated by fewer than 5 species, count up as many species as make up 80% of the vegetation.\n\nTake diagnostic photos for the 5 species (habit (whole plant), leaf, base, flowers and/or fruits).\nFor each of three individuals of your 5 target species, measure the height and canopy diameter in 2 dimensions (perpendicular). Then collect shoots for measuring leaf traits back at the lab (leaf length, width, area and dry mass). You need to collect enough to be able to process at least 3 leaves per sample (more if the species has tiny leaves). Mark each sample with masking tape and put in sample bag for the site.\n\nFinally, set a timer and take as many photos of new species (other than your 5 target species) within or near your plot as you can before the alarm goes off. Make sure to take a photo of your site label on your sample bag between sites so you know which photos were collected at which sites. When we get back to base you will upload the photos to folders in the intranet labeled by site."
