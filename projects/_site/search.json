For more information on ecological forecasting, watch the short video below or read Dietze et al. 2018 PNAS.\n\nPop over to the Ecoforecast Africa website for more info on activities and/or to join the initiative.\n\nThe following 4 minute video will give you a glossy overview of what ecological forecasting is about:"

    "text": "The NRF-funded RReTool project focused on developing Rapid and Repeatable tools for monitoring and mitigating global change impacts on natural resources in South Africa, predominantly using remote sensing.\nRecent advances in the availability of regularly updated, high resolution remotely-sensed data, combined with advances in computation have made it possible to monitor ecosystems at higher spatial and temporal resolution than previously possible. Much of the focus in research and the development of tools to make use of this new data has been in the forested ecosystems of the northern hemisphere and the tropics. More than 90% of South Africa’s terrestrial surface is covered by “open” non-forest ecosystems such as shrublands, woodlands and grasslands. Detecting abnormal change in these ecosystems is highly challenging, because the state of the vegetation varies dramatically due to natural disturbances, long-term trends or cyclical functions, such as those relating to fire, postfire recovery, and seasonality. Overcoming these challenges is critical, because open ecosystems dominate much of the globe, making up >40% of the global total ecosystem organic carbon and harbour a substantial proportion of the world’s biological diversity.\nWith the National Research Foundation funded RReTool project, we are developing tools to make full use of the potential of satellite data for monitoring the non-forests ecosystems that dominate South Africa, and to deepen our understanding of how they vary in space and time. Using this information we are improving our ability to manage and mitigate the impacts of threats such as invasive alien plants, land cover transformation and climatic change. All of this is being achieved using only freely available open source software, and publicly available data, and reproducible research principles. The information and tools generated will therefore be available at no expense to researchers and managers to use and modify as needed, allowing outputs to be regularly updated and/or improved. This will ensure that environmental resource management is informed by up-to-date accurate data."

    "text": "MedECIN: the Mediterranean-Type Ecosystem Change Intercomparison Network.\n\nWhile compiling the content on Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) for the IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 2 on Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems and their Services, it became apparent that a collaboratively coordinated long-term research agenda for intercontinental comparisons of the response of Mediterranean-type plant communities to global change was needed.\nTo address this gap, our aim is to build a coordinated network of researchers from across the five MTEs (California USA, Central Chile, SW Australia, Mediterranean Basin, and the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa). Collaboration within MedECIN will consist of (inter alia): horizon scanning, conceptual development of research questions, standardising data collection protocols, field data collection, and open-access sharing of data and code. Combining and comparing long-term vegetation datasets will support cross-site and multi-member network research, while also guiding creation of new datasets. Our approach is focused on (but not limited to) early career researchers with a focus on MTEs, to foster education and training of a new generation of researchers.\nFor more details, contact Jasper or Hana."
