[Ecoforecast Africa's](https://ecoforecast.africa/){target="_blank"} mission is to build a community of practice around near-term iterative ecological forecasting in Africa, aiming at improving our fundamental understanding of African ecosystems and translating that knowledge into tools to assist their management and conservation.

<br>

It is the African chapter of the [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/){target="_blank"}. For more information on ecological forecasting, watch the short video below or read [Dietze et al. 2018 *PNAS*](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710231115){target="_blank"}.
