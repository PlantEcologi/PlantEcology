Ecoforecast Africa is the seed of an African chapter of the [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/). For more information on ecological forecasting, watch the short video below or read [Dietze et al. 2018 *PNAS*](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710231115).

At this stage we are only gathering information of those interested in participating in or contributing to the initiative. If that includes you, please fill in [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/8TFEigaaWoJPGXPe8). This information will only be used for Ecoforecast Africa planning activities and will not be shared with others or used for research purposes. Please note that form responses are not monitored, so if you have any queries please contact Jasper Slingsby directly.

Note that Ecoforecast Africa may adopt a different model to other EFI chapters due to differences in the needs and resources of the region (see [Slingsby et al. 2023 *MEE*](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.14046)). What model we adopt for will be up for discussion. Also note that while we (Jasper Slingsby and Glenn Moncrieff) are kickstarting the initiative, we do not claim ownership and invite broad participation, diverse perspectives and suggestions for the best leadership model.

The following 4 minute video will give you a glossy overview of what ecological is about:
