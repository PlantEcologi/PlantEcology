## Mission

We aim to produce graduates who are ecologically and data literate, engaged, and have the wit to never stop questioning the "facts" presented in whatever walk of life they choose.

We hope to cultivate a sense of environmental consciousness and biophilia in our students and others, ultimately sharing "the pleasure of finding things out" _sensu_ Richard Feynman.
