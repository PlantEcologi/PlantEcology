## Practicals by year

* [2025](https://www.ecologi.st/BIO3018F/PracPresentation2025)
* [2023](/teaching/bio3018f/2023/)

While the practicals have differed between years, you're welcome to go through the older ones for ideas and inspiration.

I provide R code, which you can run on your own laptops if you have R installed (and it helps to have RStudio or similar). Alternatively, you can sign up for an account on [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/), which allows you to run the code on a cloud machine from your internet browser. Make sure to use your university email address as it allows you more free resources.
